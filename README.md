## useState_Counters
Built a React application that includes a Counter component. This renders three instances of this Counter component, each with its own state. Then passing the state and the function to update it as props to each Counter component.

## useState-The_Light_Bulb
Built a React application that uses components. Assigned an event to the button so it toggles a state boolean variable wich switches "On" and "Off" to the light bulb. This is to mainly demostrate how to conditionally render events based on the state.

## useState-ContactForm
In this React application, A Contact form is created. The contact form includes (Name field, Email field, Telephone field and Message field). The main objective of the application is to control the form with a single pieve of state. On top of that, when the form is submitted, it should:
- Prevent the default behaviour
- Validate that all fields have data
- Output form data to console.
